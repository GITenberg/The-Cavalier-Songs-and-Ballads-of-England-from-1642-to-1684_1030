<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cavalier Ballads of England,
like the Jacobite Ballads of England and Scotland at a later
period, are mines of wealth for the student of the history and
social manners of our ancestors.&nbsp; The rude but often
beautiful political lyrics of the early days of the Stuarts were
far more interesting and important to the people who heard or
repeated them, than any similar compositions can be in our
time.&nbsp; When the printing press was the mere vehicle of
polemics for the educated minority, and when the daily journal
was neither a luxury of the poor, a necessity of the rich, nor an
appreciable power in the formation and guidance of public
opinion, the song and the ballad appealed to the passion, if not
to the intellect of the masses, and instructed them in all the
leading events of the time.&nbsp; In our day the people need no
information <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>of the kind, for they procure it from the more readily
available and more copious if not more reliable, source of the
daily and weekly press.&nbsp; The song and ballad have ceased to
deal with public affairs.&nbsp; No new ones of the kind are made
except as miserable parodies and burlesques that may amuse sober
costermongers and half-drunken men about town, who frequent music
saloons at midnight, but which are offensive to every one
else.&nbsp; Such genuine old ballads as remain in the popular
memory are either fast dying out, or relate exclusively to the
never-to-be-superseded topics of love, war, and wine.&nbsp; The
people of our day have little heart or appreciation for song,
except in Scotland and Ireland.&nbsp; England and America are too
prosaic and too busy, and the masses, notwithstanding all their
supposed advantages in education, are much too vulgar to delight
in either song or ballad that rises to the dignity of
poetry.&nbsp; They appreciate the buffooneries of the
&ldquo;Negro Minstrelsy,&rdquo; and the inanities and the
vapidities of sentimental love songs, but the elegance of such
writers as Thomas Moore, and the force of such vigorous thinkers
and tender lyrists as Robert Burns, are above their sphere, and
are left to scholars in their closets and ladies in their
drawing-rooms.&nbsp; The case was different among our ancestors
<a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>in the
memorable period of the struggle for liberty that commenced in
the reign of Charles I.&nbsp; The Puritans had the pulpit on
their side, and found it a powerful instrument.&nbsp; The
Cavaliers had the song writers on theirs, and found them equally
effective.&nbsp; And the song and ballad writers of that day were
not always illiterate versifiers.&nbsp; Some of them were the
choicest wits and most accomplished gentlemen of the
nation.&nbsp; As they could not reach the ears of their
countrymen by the printed book, the pamphlet, or the newspaper,
nor mount the pulpit and dispute with Puritanism on its own
ground and in its own precincts, they found the song, the ballad,
and the epigram more available among a musical and song-loving
people such as the English then were, and trusted to these to
keep up the spirit of loyalty in the evil days of the royal
cause, to teach courage in adversity, and cheerfulness in all
circumstances, and to ridicule the hypocrites whom they could not
shame, and the tyrants whom they could not overthrow.&nbsp;
Though many thousands of these have been preserved in the
King&rsquo;s Pamphlets in the British Museum, and in other
collections which have been freely ransacked for the materials of
the following pages, as many thousands more have undoubtedly
perished.&nbsp; <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>Originally printed as broadsides, and sold for a
halfpenny at country fairs, it used to be the fashion of the
peasantry to paste them up in cupboards, or on the backs of
doors, and farmers&rsquo; wives, as well as servant girls and
farm labourers, who were able to read, would often paste them on
the lids of their trunks, as the best means of preserving
them.&nbsp; This is one reason why so many of them have been lost
without recovery.&nbsp; To Sir W. C. Trevelyan literature is
indebted for the restoration of a few of these waifs and strays,
which he found pasted in an old trunk of the days of Cromwell,
and which he carefully detached and presented to the British
Museum.&nbsp; But a sufficient number of these flying leaves of
satire, sentiment, and loyalty have reached our time, to throw a
curious and instructive light upon the feelings of the men who
resisted the progress of the English Revolution; and who made
loyalty to the person of the monarch, even when the monarch was
wrong, the first of the civic virtues.&nbsp; In the
superabundance of the materials at command, as will be seen from
the appended list of books and MSS. which have been consulted and
drawn upon to form this collection, the difficulty was to keep
within bounds, and to select only such specimens as merited a
place in a volume necessarily limited, by <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>their
celebrity, their wit, their beauty, their historical interest, or
the light they might happen to throw on the obscure biography of
the most remarkable actors in the scenes which they
describe.&nbsp; It would be too much to claim for these ballads
the exalted title of poetry.&nbsp; They are not poetical in the
highest sense of the word, and possibly would not have been so
effective for the purpose which they were intended to serve, if
their writers had been more fanciful and imaginative, or less
intent upon what they had to say than upon the manner of saying
it.&nbsp; But if not extremely poetical, they are extremely
national, and racy of the soil; and some of them are certain to
live as long as the language which produced them.&nbsp; For the
convenience of reference and consultation they have been arranged
chronologically; beginning with the discontents that inaugurated
the reign of Charles I., and following regularly to the final,
though short-lived, triumph of the Cavalier cause, in the
accession of James II.&nbsp; After his ill-omened advent to the
throne, the Cavalier became the Jacobite.&nbsp; In this
collection no Jacobite songs, properly so called, are included,
it being the intention of the publishers to issue a companion
volume, of the Jacobite Ballads of England, from the accession of
James II. to the battle of <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>Culloden, should the public receive
the present volume with sufficient favour to justify the
venture.</p>
<p>The Editor cannot, in justice to previous fellow-labourers,
omit to record his obligation to the interesting volume, with its
learned annotations, contributed by Mr Thomas Wright to the Percy
Society; or to another and equally valuable collection, edited by
Mr J. O. Halliwell.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CAVALIER
SONGS AND BALLADS.</h2>
<h3>WHEN THE KING ENJOYS HIS OWN AGAIN.</h3>
<p>This is perhaps the most popular of all the Cavalier
songs&mdash;a favour which it partly owes to the excellent melody
with which it is associated.&nbsp; The song, says Mr Chappell, is
ascertained to be by Martin Parker, by the following extract from
the <i>Gossips&rsquo; Feast</i>, or Moral Tales, 1647.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By my faith, Martin Parker never got a fairer treat: no,
not when he indited that sweet ballad, When the King enjoys his
own again.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the poet&rsquo;s Blind Man&rsquo;s
Bough (or Buff), 1641, Martin Parker says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whatever yet was published by me<br />
Was known as Martin Parker, or M. P.;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but this song was printed without his name or initials, at a
time when it would have been dangerous to give either his own
name or that of his publisher.&nbsp; Ritson calls it the most
famous song of any time or country.&nbsp; Invented to support the
declining interest of Charles I., it served afterwards with more
success to keep up the spirits of the Cavaliers, and promote the
restoration of his son; an event which it was employed to
celebrate all over the kingdom.&nbsp; At the Revolution of 1688,
it of course became an adherent of the exiled King, whose cause
it never deserted.&nbsp; It did equal service in 1715 and
1745.&nbsp; The tune appears to have been originally known as
<i>Marry me</i>, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span><i>marry me</i>, <i>quoth he</i>, <i>bonnie
lass</i>.&nbsp; Booker, Pond, Hammond, Rivers, Swallow, Dade, and
&ldquo;The Man in the Moon,&rdquo; were all astrologers and
Almanac makers in the early days of the civil war.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Man in the Moon&rdquo; appears to have been a loyalist
in his predictions.&nbsp; Hammond&rsquo;s Almanac is called
&ldquo;bloody&rdquo; because the compiler always took care to
note the anniversary of the death, execution, or downfall of a
Royalist.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">What</span> <i>Booker</i> doth prognosticate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning kings&rsquo; or kingdoms&rsquo; fate?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think myself to be as wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he that gazeth on the skies;<br />
My skill goes beyond the depth of a <i>Pond</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or <i>Rivers</i> in the greatest rain,<br />
Thereby I can tell all things will be well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s neither
<i>Swallow</i>, <i>Dove</i>, nor <i>Dade</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can soar more high, or deeper wade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor show a reason from the stars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What causeth peace or civil wars;<br />
The Man in the Moon may wear out his shoon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By running after Charles his wain:<br />
But all&rsquo;s to no end, for the times will not mend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though for a time we see
Whitehall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With cobwebs hanging on the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of silk and silver brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which formerly it used to have,<br />
With rich perfume in every room,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delightful to that princely train,<br />
Which again you shall see, when the time it shall be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Full forty years the royal crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath been his father&rsquo;s and his own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And is there any one but he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in the same should sharer be?<br />
For who better may the sceptre sway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than he that hath such right to reign?<br />
Then let&rsquo;s hope for a peace, for the wars will not cease<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Did <i>Walker</i> no
predictions lack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hammond&rsquo;s bloody almanack?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foretelling things that would ensue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all proves right, if lies be true;<br />
But why should not he the pillory foresee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein poor Toby once was ta&rsquo;en?<br />
And also foreknow to the gallows he must go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the King enjoys his own again?] <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till then upon Ararat&rsquo;s
hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My hope shall cast her anchor still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I see some peaceful dove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring home the branch I dearly love;<br />
Then will I wait till the waters abate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which now disturb my troubled brain,<br />
Else never rejoice till I hear the voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<h3><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>WHEN THE
KING COMES HOME IN PEACE AGAIN.</h3>
<p>From a broadside in the Roxburghe Collection of Ballads.&nbsp;
It appears to have been written shortly after Martin
Parker&rsquo;s original ballad obtained popularity among the
Royalists, and to be by another hand.&nbsp; It bears neither date
nor printer&rsquo;s name; and has &ldquo;God save the King,
Amen,&rdquo; in large letters at the end.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Oxford</span> and Cambridge shall agree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With honour crown&rsquo;d, and dignity;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For learned men shall then take place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bad be silenced with disgrace:<br />
They&rsquo;ll know it to be but a casualty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hath so long disturb&rsquo;d their brain;<br />
For I can surely tell that all things will go well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the King comes home in peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church government shall
settled be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I hope we shall agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without their help, whose high-brain&rsquo;d zeal<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath long disturb&rsquo;d the common weal;<br />
Greed out of date, and cobblers that do prate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of wars that still disturb their brain;<br />
The which you will see, when the time it shall be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the King comes home in peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though many now are much in
debt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many shops are to be let,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden time is drawing near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men shops shall take to hold their ware;<br />
And then all our trade shall flourishing be made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which ere long we shall attain;<br />
For still I can tell all things will be well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the King comes home in peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page5"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp; And honest men their lost estates;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Women shall have what they do lack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their husbands, who are coming back.<br />
When the wars have an end, then I and my friend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All subjects&rsquo; freedom shall obtain;<br />
By which I can tell all things will be well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we enjoy sweet peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though people now walk in
great fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the country everywhere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thieves shall then tremble at the law,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And justice shall keep them in awe:<br />
The Frenchies shall flee with their treacherie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the foes of the King ashamed remain:<br />
The which you shall see when the time it shall be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the King comes home in peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament must willing
be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all the world may plainly see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How they do labour still for peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That now these bloody wars may cease;<br />
For they will gladly spend their lives to defend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King in all his right to reign:<br />
So then I can tell all things will be well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we enjoy sweet peace again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all these things to pass
shall come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then farewell Musket, Pick, and Drum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lamb shall with the Lion feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which were a happy time indeed.<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>O let us
pray we may all see the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That peace may govern in his name,<br />
For then I can tell all things will be well<br />

<h3>I LOVE MY KING AND COUNTRY WELL.</h3>
<p>From Songs and other Poems by Alex. Brome, Gent.&nbsp;

<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">love</span> my King and

one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the wars

The ground does tipple healths afar<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sighing does but waste our breath.<br />
Then let us not be discontent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor drink a glass the less of wine;<br />
In vain they&rsquo;ll think their plagues are spent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When once they see we don&rsquo;t repine.</p>
<p class="poetry">We do not suffer here alone,<br />

In sign of obedience,<br />

Of the guards, with quart pots<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shall fuddle the sots,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we make &rsquo;em both
cuckolds and freemen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on their wives beat up alarums.<br />

Thus as each health passes<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll triple the glasses,<br />
And hold it no sin<br />
To be loyal and drink in defence of our King.</p>

<h3>THE MAN O&rsquo; THE MOON.</h3>
<p>Hogg, in his second series of Jacobite Relics, states that he
&ldquo;got this song among some old papers belonging to Mr Orr of
Alloa,&rdquo; and that he never met with it elsewhere.&nbsp; In
his first series he printed a Scottish song beginning,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Then was a man came fron the moon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And landed in our town, sir,<br />
And he has sworn a solemn oath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all but knaves must down, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Martin Parker&rsquo;s foregoing ballad, &ldquo;When the
King enjoys his own again,&rdquo; there is also an allusion to
the man in the moon:&mdash;</p>

<p>as it would appear that the &ldquo;Man in the Moon,&rdquo; was
the title assumed by an almanack-maker of the time of the
Commonwealth, who, like other astronomers and astrologers,
predicted the King&rsquo;s restoration.&nbsp; In this song the
&ldquo;Man o&rsquo; the Moon&rdquo; clearly signifies King
Charles.</p>

The true heart ne&rsquo;er shall fail thee;<br />

<h3>VIVE LE ROY.</h3>
<p>From a collection of songs, 1640 to 1660.&nbsp; It is also to
be found in the additional MSS., No. 11, 608, p. 54, in the
collection in the British Museum.&nbsp; It was sung to the air of
Love lies bleeding,&mdash;and was, says Mr Chappell, &ldquo;the
God save the King&rdquo; of Charles I., Charles II., and James
II.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> though the
zealots pull down the prelates,<br />
Push at the pulpit, and kick at the crown,<br />
Shall we not never once more endeavour,<br />
Strive to purchase our royall renown?<br />
Shall not the Roundhead first be confounded?<br />
Sa, sa, sa, say, boys, ha, ha, ha, ha, boys,<br />
Then we&rsquo;ll return with triumph and joy.<br />
Then we&rsquo;ll be merry, drink white wine and sherry,<br />
Then we will sing, boys, God bless the King, boys,<br />
Cast up our caps, and cry, <i>Vive le Roy</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">What though the wise make Alderman Isaac<br />

And when you venture London to enter,<br />
And when you come, boys, with fife and drum, boys,<br />
Isaac himself shall cry, <i>Vive le Roy</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">If you will choose them, do not refuse them,<br

Since honest Parliament never made thieves,<br />
Charles will not further have rogues dipt in murder,<br />
Neither by leases, long lives, nor reprieves.<br />

Will not be granted, then be not daunted,<br />

<h3>HEY, THEN, UP GO WE.</h3>
<p>This song, says Mr Chappell, in his Popular Music of the Olden
Time, which describes with some humour the taste of the Puritans,
might pass for a Puritan song, if it were not contained in the
&ldquo;Shepherds&rsquo; Oracles,&rdquo; by Francis Quarles,
1646.&nbsp; He was cup-bearer to Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia,
daughter of James I., and afterwards chronologer to the city of
London.&nbsp; He died in 1644, and his Shepherds&rsquo; Oracles
were a posthumous publication.&nbsp; It was often reprinted
during the Restoration, and reproduced and slightly altered by
Thomas Durfey, in his &ldquo;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&rdquo;
where the burthen is, &ldquo;Hey, boys, up go we.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Know</span> this, my

popular among the Cavaliers both of England and Scotland in the

at a Presbyterian church.</p>

ROYAL FEAST.</h3>
<p>A Loyall Song of the Royall Feast kept by the Prisoners in the
Towre, August last, with the Names, Titles, and Characters of
every Prisoner.&nbsp; By Sir F. W., Knight and Baronet,
Prisoner.&nbsp; (Sept. 16th, 1647.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the negotiations between the King and the Parliament
during the summer and autumn of this year,&rdquo; says Mr Thomas
Wright in his Political Ballads of the Commonwealth, published
for the Percy Society, &ldquo;the case of the royalist prisoners
in the Tower was frequently brought into question.&nbsp; The
latter seized the occasion of complaining against the rigours
(complaints apparently exaggerated) which were exerted against
them, and on the 16th June, 1647, was published &lsquo;A True
Relation of the cruell and unparallel&rsquo;d Oppression which
hath been illegally imposed upon the Gentlemen Prisoners in the
Tower of London.&rsquo;&nbsp; The several petitions contained in
this tract have the signatures of Francis Howard, Henry
Bedingfield, Walter Blount, Giles Strangwaies, Francis Butler,
Henry Vaughan, Thomas Lunsford, Richard Gibson, Tho. Violet, John
Morley, Francis Wortley, Edw. Bishop, John Hewet, Wingfield
Bodenham, Henry Warren, W. Morton, John Slaughter, Gilbert
Swinhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 19th of August (according to the <span
class="smcap">Moderate Intelligencer</span> of that date) the
King sent to the royal prisoners in the Tower two fat bucks for a
feast.&nbsp; This circumstance was the origin of the present
ballad.&nbsp; It was written by Sir Francis Wortley, one of the
prisoners.&nbsp; This ballad, as we learn by the concluding
lines, was to be sung to the popular tune of &ldquo;Chevy
Chace.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE CITIES LOYALTIE TO THE KING.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">(Aug. 13th, 1647.)</p>
<p>The city of London made several demonstrations this year to
support the Presbyterian party in the Parliament against the
Independents and the army.&nbsp; In the latter end of September,
after the army had marched to London, and the Parliament <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>acted under
its influence, the lord mayor and a large part of the aldermen
were committed to the Tower on the charge of high treason; and a
new mayor for the rest of the year was appointed by the
Parliament.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">To the tune of &ldquo;London is a
fine town and a gallant city.&rdquo;</p>

Why rode my Lord up Fleet-street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With coaches at least twenty,<br />
And fill&rsquo;d they say with aldermen,<br />

<h3>THE DOWNFAL OF CHARING-CROSS.</h3>
<p>Charing-Cross, as it stood before the civil wars, was one of
those beautiful Gothic obelisks, erected to conjugal affection by
Edward I., who built such a one wherever the hearse of his
beloved Eleanor rested in its way from Lincolnshire to
Westminster.&nbsp; But neither its ornamental situation, the
beauty of its structure, nor the noble design of its erection
(which did honour to humanity), could preserve it from the
merciless zeal of the times; for in 1647 it was demolished by
order of the House of Commons, as Popish and superstitious.&nbsp;
This occasioned the following not unhumorous sarcasm, which has
been often printed among the popular sonnets of those times.</p>
<p>The plot referred to in ver. 3 was that entered into by Mr
Waller the poet, and others, with a view to reduce the city and
Tower to the service of the King; for which two of them, Nath.
Tomkins and Richard Chaloner, suffered death, July 5, 1643.&nbsp;

English Poetry</i>.</p>

are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They wander about the towne,<br />
Nor can find the way to Westminster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Charing-Cross is downe:<br />
At the end of the Strand they make a stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swearing they are at a loss,<br />
And chaffing say, that&rsquo;s not the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They must go by Charing-Cross.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Parliament to vote it down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceived it very fitting,<br />
For fear it should fall, and kill them all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the House as they were sitting.<br />
They were told god-wot, it had a plot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made them so hard-hearted,<br />
To give command it should not stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But be taken down and carted.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men talk of plots, this might have been
worse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For anything I know,<br />
Than that <i>Tomkins</i> and <i>Chaloner</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were hang&rsquo;d for long agoe.<br />
Our Parliament did that prevent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wisely them defended,<br />
For plots they will discover still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before they were intended.</p>
<p class="poetry">But neither man, woman, nor child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will say, I&rsquo;m confident,<br />
They ever heard it speak one word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the Parliament.<br />
An informer swore it letters bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else it had been freed;<br />
In troth I&rsquo;ll take my Bible oath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It could neither write nor read.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>The Committee said that verify<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Popery it was bent:<br />
For ought I know, it might be so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to church it never went.<br />
What with excise, and such device,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kingdom doth begin<br />
To think you&rsquo;ll leave them ne&rsquo;er a cross<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without doors nor within.</p>
<p class="poetry">Methinks the Common-council should<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of it have taken pity,<br />
&rsquo;Cause, good old cross, it always stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So firmly to the city.<br />
Since crosses you so much disdain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith, if I were as you,<br />
For fear the King should rule again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d pull down Tiburn too.</p>
<p>Whitlocke says, &ldquo;May 3rd, 1643, Cheapside Cross and
other crosses were voted down,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; When this
vote was put in execution does not appear; probably not till many
mouths after Tomkins and Chaloner had suffered.</p>
<p>We had a very curious account of the pulling down of Cheapside
Cross lately published in one of the Numbers of the
<i>Gentlemen&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, 1766.&mdash;<i>Percy&rsquo;s

<p>The last news from France, being a true relation of the escape
of the King of Scots from Worcester to London and from London to
France,&mdash;who was conveyed away by a young gentleman in
woman&rsquo;s apparel; the King of Scots attending on this
supposed gentlewoman in manner of a serving-man.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fight of Northern Rats.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas I
did convey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Highness
away,<br />
And from all dangers set him free;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In woman
attire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As reason did
require,<br />
And the King himself did wait on me.</p>
<p class="poetry">He of me a service did crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And oftentimes to me stood bare;<br />
In woman&rsquo;s apparel he was most brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his chin he had no hare;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever I
came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My speeches did

<p class="poetry">My waiting-man a jewel had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I for want of money sold;<br />
Because my fortune was so bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We turn&rsquo;d our jewel into gold.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good shift
indeed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In time of our
need,<br />
Then glad was I and glad was he;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our cause it did
advance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until we came to
France,<br />
And the King himself did wait on me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where law and justice doth take place<br />
Our grief was great, our comfort small,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lookt round
about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And made no

But I and my man should taken be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people
little knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I may tell to
you,<br />

<p class="poetry">From thence we went to the fatal place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where his father lost his life;<br />
And then my man did weep apace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorrow with him then was rife.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bid him
peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let sorrow
cease,<br />
For fear that we should taken be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gallants in
Whitehall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did little know
at all<br />
That the King himself did wait on me.</p>
<p class="poetry">The King he was my serving-man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus the plot we did contrive:<br />
I went by the name of Mistress Anne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we took water at Queenhythe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A boat there we
took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And London
forsook,<br />
And now in France arrived are we.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got away by
stealth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the King is
in good health,<br />
And he shall no longer wait on me.</p>
<p class="poetry">The King of Denmark&rsquo;s dead, they say,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Charles is like to rule the land;<br />
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>In France
he will no longer stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I do rightly understand.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That land is his

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they be but
true,<br />
And he with them do well agree:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard a bird
sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he once be
their king,<br />
My man will then my master be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Heaven grant them better success<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their young king than England had;<br />
Free from war and from distress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fortune may not be so bad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the case
thus stands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let neighbouring
lands<br />
Lay down their arms and at quiet be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as for my
part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad with
all my heart<br />
That my King must now my master be.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus I have declared to you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By what means we escaped away;<br />
Now we bid our cares adieu,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the King did lose the day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him I was
true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that he well
knew;<br />
&rsquo;Tis God that must his comfort be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else all our
policy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had been but
foolery,<br />
For the King no longer waits on me.</p>

<h3>A CHRISTMAS SONG WHEN THE RUMP WAS FIRST DISSOLVED.</h3>
<p>From the King&rsquo;s Pamphlets, British Museum.&nbsp; The
Rump Parliament, in an excess of Puritanic acerbity, had
abolished the observance of Christmas, and forbidden the eating
of puddings and pies, as savouring of Popery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Tune&mdash;&ldquo;I tell thee,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> Christmas time
&rsquo;tis fit that we<br />
Should feast, and sing, and merry be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a time of mirth;<br />
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>For
never since the world began<br />
More joyful news was brought to man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than at our Saviour&rsquo;s
birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">But such have been these times of late,<br />
That holidays are out of date,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And holiness to boot;<br />
For they that do despise and scorn<br />
To keep the day that Christ was born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want holiness no doubt.</p>
<p class="poetry">That Parliament that took away<br />
The observation of that day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know it was not free;<br />
For if it had, such acts as those<br />
Had ne&rsquo;er been seen in verse or prose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may conclude with me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas that Assembly did maintain<br />
&rsquo;Twas law to kill their sovereign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who by that law must die;<br />
Though God&rsquo;s anointed ones are such,<br />
Which subjects should not dare to touch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much less to crucify.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas that which turn&rsquo;d our bishops
out<br />
Of house and home, both branch and root,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave no reason why;<br />
And all our clergy did expel,<br />
That would not do like that rebel&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This no man can deny.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was that Parliament that took<br />
Out of our churches our <i>Service book</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A book without compare;<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>And made
God&rsquo;s house (to all our griefs),<br />
That house of prayer, a den of thiefs&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both here and everywhere.</p>
<p class="poetry">They had no head for many years,<br />
Nor heart (I mean the House of Peers),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet it did not die;<br />
Of these long since it was bereft,<br />
And nothing but the tail was left,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know as well as I.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in this tail was a tongue,<br />
Lenthal <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> I mean, whose fame hath rung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In country and in city;<br />
Not for his worth or eloquence,<br />
But for a rebel to his prince,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And neither wise nor witty.</p>
<p class="poetry">This Speaker&rsquo;s words must needs be
wind,<br />
Since they proceeded from behind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, you way remember,<br />
From thence no act could be discreet,<br />
Nor could the sense o&rsquo; the House be sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Atkins was a member.</p>
<p class="poetry">This tale&rsquo;s now done, the Speaker&rsquo;s
dumb,<br />
Thanks to the trumpet and the drum;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I hope to see<br />
A Parliament that will restore<br />
All things that were undone before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may Christians be.</p>

And who would not venture a cast for a crown, boys?<br />
Since we wear the right colours, he the worst of our foes is<br

Are active to do what our rulers require us,<br />
And attempt such exploits as the world shall admire us.</p>

<h3>THE PROTECTING BREWER.</h3>
<p>This was apparently written as a parody on the Brewer, in
Pills to purge Melancholy, 1682.&nbsp; The original was too
complimentary to Oliver Cromwell, asserted by the Royalists to
have been a brewer in early life, to suit the taste of the
Cavaliers, and hence the alteration made in it.&nbsp; Such
compliments as the following must have proceeded from a writer of
the opposite party.</p>

<h3>THE ARRAIGNMENT OF THE DEVIL FOR STEALING AWAY PRESIDENT
BRADSHAW.</h3>
<p>John Bradshaw, who had presided over the court of justice
which condemned Charles I. to the scaffold, and who by his
extreme republican principles had rendered himself obnoxious to
Cromwell, began again to be distinguished in public affairs after
the Protector&rsquo;s death, and was elected President of the
Council of State.&nbsp; He did not live long to enjoy this
honour, but died, according to some authorities, on the 31st
October, 1659.&nbsp; Chalmers places his death on the 22nd of
November in that year.</p>

<h3>SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON,<br />
ANGLICE MERCURIUS POETICUS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The following ballad,&rdquo; says Mr Wright in the
Political Ballads of the Commonwealth, published for the Percy
Society, &ldquo;was written on the occasion of the overthrow of
the Rump by Monck.&nbsp; He arrived in London on the third of
February, and professed himself a determined supporter of the
party then uppermost.&nbsp; On the ninth and tenth he executed
their orders against the city; but suddenly on the eleventh he
joined the city and the Presbyterian party, and demanded the
readmission <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>of the members who were secluded formerly from the Long
Parliament.&nbsp; This measure put an end to the reign of the
Rump, and immediately afterwards the Parliament dissolved itself,
and a new one was called.&mdash;(February 28th,
1659.)&rdquo;&mdash;All the notes to this Ballad are from the pen
of Mr Wright.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(January 1659&ndash;60.)&mdash;From
a broadside, vol. xv. in the King&rsquo;s Pamphlets.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The condition of the State was thus: viz.
the Rump, after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert, was lately
returned to sit again.&nbsp; The officers of the army all forced
to yield.&nbsp; Lawson lies still in the river, and Monk is with
his army in Scotland.&nbsp; Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come
in to the Parliament, nor is it expected that he will without
being forced to it.&nbsp; The new Common Council of the city do
speak very high; and had sent to Monk their sword-bearer to
acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament,
which is at present the desires, and the hopes, and the
expectations of all.&nbsp; Twenty-two of the old secluded members
having been at the House-door the last week to demand entrance,
but it was denied them; and it is believed that neither they nor
the people will be satisfied till the House be
filled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pepys&rsquo; Diary, January, 1660.</p>

<h3>A PROPER NEW BALLAD ON THE OLD PARLIAMENT;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
THE SECOND PART OF KNAVE OUT OF DOORS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">To the tune of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hei ho, my honey, my heart shall never
rue,<br />
Four-and-twenty now for your mony, and yet a hard penny-worth
too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">(Dec. 11th, 1659.)&mdash;From the
King&rsquo;s Pamphlets, British Museum.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The events which gave occasion to the
following ballad,&rdquo; says Mr T. Wright in his Political
Ballads, published for the Percy Society, &ldquo;may be summed up
in a few words.&nbsp; After the death of Cromwell, his son
Richard was without opposition raised to the Protectorate; but
his weak and easy character gave an opening to the intrigues of
the Royalists, and the factious movement of the Republican
party.&nbsp; Fleetwood, who had been named commander-in-chief of
the army under the Protector, plotted to gain the chief power in
the State, and was joined by Lambert, Desborough, and
others.&nbsp; The Republicans were strengthened by the return of
Vane, Ludlow, and Bradshaw, to the Parliament called by the new
Protector.&nbsp; Lambert, the Protector&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
was the ostensible head of a party, and seems to have aimed at
obtaining the power which had been held by Oliver.&nbsp; They
formed a council of officers, who met at Wallingford House; and
on the 20th April, 1659, having <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>gained the upper hand, and having
obtained the dissolution of the Parliament, they determined to
restore the old Long Parliament, which they said had only been
interrupted, and not legally dissolved, and to set aside the
Protector, who soon afterwards resigned.&nbsp; On the 21st April,
Lenthall, the old Speaker, with as many members of the Long
Parliament as could be brought together, met in the House, and
opened their session.&nbsp; The Parliament thus formed, as being
the fag-end of the old Long Parliament, obtained the name of the
Rump Parliament.&nbsp; Lambert&rsquo;s hopes and aims were raised
by his success against Sir George Booth in the August following,
and jealousies soon arose between his party in the army and the
Rump.&nbsp; The Parliament would have dismissed him, and the
chief officers in the cabal with him, but Lambert with the army
in October hindered their free meeting, and took the management
of the government into the hands of a council of officers, whom
they called the Committee of Safety.&nbsp; Towards the latter end
of the year, the tide began to be changed in favour of the
Parliament, by the declaration of Monk in Scotland, Henry
Cromwell with the army in Ireland, and Hazelrigge and the
officers at Portsmouth, in favour of the freedom of the
Parliament.&nbsp; This ballad was written at the period when
Lambert&rsquo;s party was uppermost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tune of &ldquo;Hei ho, my honey,&rdquo; may be found in
Playford&rsquo;s edition of &ldquo;The English Dancing
Master,&rdquo; printed in 1686, but in no earlier edition of the
same work.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not cut his beard<br />
Till this ungodly nation was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From kings and bishops clear&rsquo;d:</p>
<p class="poetry">Which holy vow he firmly kept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And most devoutly wore<br />
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>A grizly
meteor on his face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they were both no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">His worship was, in short, a man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of such exceeding worth,<br />
No pen or pencil can describe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rhyming bard set forth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Many and mighty things he did<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sober and in liquor,&mdash;<br />
Witness the mortal fray between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cobbler and the Vicar;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which by his wisdom and his power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wisely did prevent,<br />
And both the combatants at once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wooden durance pent.</p>
<p class="poetry">The manner how these two fell out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quarrell&rsquo;d in their ale,<br />
I shall attempt at large to show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the succeeding tale.</p>
<p class="poetry">A strolling cobbler, who was wont<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To trudge from town to town,<br />
Happen&rsquo;d upon his walk to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A vicar in his gown.</p>
<p class="poetry">And as they forward jogg&rsquo;d along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar, growing hot,<br />
First asked the cobbler if he knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they might take a pot?</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, marry that I do, quoth he;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a house hard by,<br />
That far exceeds all Bedfordshire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ale and landlady.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>Thither let&rsquo;s go, the vicar said;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when they thither came,<br />
He liked the liquor wondrous well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But better far the dame.</p>
<p class="poetry">And she, who, like a cunning jilt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knew how to please her guest,<br />
Used all her little tricks and arts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To entertain the priest.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler too, who quickly saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The landlady&rsquo;s design,<br />
Did all that in his power was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To manage the divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">With smutty jests and merry songs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They charm&rsquo;d the vicar so,<br />
That he determined for that night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No further he would go.</p>
<p class="poetry">And being fixt, the cobbler thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas proper to go try<br />
If he could get a job or two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His charges to supply.</p>
<p class="poetry">So going out into the street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He bawls with all his might,&mdash;<br />
If any of you tread awry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m here to set you right.</p>
<p class="poetry">I can repair your leaky boots,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And underlay your soles;<br />
Backsliders, I can underprop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And patch up all your holes.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vicar, who unluckily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cobbler&rsquo;s outcry heard,<br />
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>From off
the bench on which he sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With mighty fury rear&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">Quoth he, What priest, what holy priest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can hear this bawling slave,<br />
But must, in justice to his coat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chastise the saucy knave?</p>
<p class="poetry">What has this wretch to do with souls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or with backsliders either,<br />
Whose business only is his awls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His lasts, his thread, and leather?</p>
<p class="poetry">I lose my patience to be made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This strolling varlet&rsquo;s sport;<br />
Nor could I think this saucy rogue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could serve me in such sort.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler, who had no design<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar to displease,<br />
Unluckily repeats again,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come your soals to ease:</p>
<p class="poetry">The inward and the outward too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I can repair and mend;<br />
And all that my assistance want,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll use them like a friend.</p>
<p class="poetry">The country folk no sooner heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The honest cobbler&rsquo;s tongue,<br />
But from the village far and near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They round about him throng.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some bring their boots, and some their
shoes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some their buskins bring:<br />
The cobbler sits him down to work,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then begins to sing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Death often at the cobbler&rsquo;s stall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was wont to make a stand,<br />
But found the cobbler singing still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the mending hand;</p>
<p class="poetry">Until at length he met old Time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they both together<br />
Quite tear the cobbler&rsquo;s aged sole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From off the upper leather.</p>
<p class="poetry">Even so a while I may old shoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By care and art maintain,<br />
But when the leather&rsquo;s rotten grown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All art and care is vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus the cobbler stitched and sung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not thinking any harm;<br />
Till out the angry vicar came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ale and passion warm.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dost thou not know, vile slave! quoth he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How impious &rsquo;tis to jest<br />
With sacred things, and to profane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The office of a priest?</p>
<p class="poetry">How dar&rsquo;st thou, most audacious
wretch!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those vile expressions use,<br />
Which make the souls of men as cheap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As soals of boots and shoes?</p>
<p class="poetry">Such reprobates as you betray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our character and gown,<br />
And would, if you had once the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church itself pull down.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler, not aware that he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had done or said amiss,<br />
<a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>Reply&rsquo;d, I do not understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What you can mean by this.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tho&rsquo; I but a poor cobbler be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stroll about for bread,<br />
None better loves the Church than I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever wore a head.</p>
<p class="poetry">But since you are so good at names,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make so loud a pother,<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly I&rsquo;m afraid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re but some cobbling brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, vicar, tho&rsquo; you talk so big,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our trades are near akin;<br />
I patch and cobble outward soals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As you do those within.</p>
<p class="poetry">And I&rsquo;ll appeal to any man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That understands the nation,<br />
If I han&rsquo;t done more good than you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In my respective station.</p>
<p class="poetry">Old leather, I must needs confess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sometimes used as new,<br />
And often pared the soal so near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have spoil&rsquo;d the shoe.</p>
<p class="poetry">You vicars, by a different way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have done the very same;<br />
For you have pared your doctrines so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You made religion lame.</p>
<p class="poetry">Your principles you&rsquo;ve quite
disown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And old ones changed for new,<br />
That no man can distinguish right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which are the false or true.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>I dare be bold, you&rsquo;re one of those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have took the Covenant;<br />
With Cavaliers are Cavalier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the saints a saint.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vicar at this sharp rebuke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Begins to storm and swear;<br />
Quoth he, Thou vile apostate wretch!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dost thou with me compare?</p>
<p class="poetry">I that have care of many souls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And power to damn or save,<br />
Dar&rsquo;st thou thyself compare with me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou vile, ungodly knave!</p>
<p class="poetry">I wish I had thee somewhere else,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d quickly make thee know<br />
What &rsquo;tis to make comparisons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to revile me so.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou art an enemy to the State,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some priest in masquerade,<br />
That, to promote the Pope&rsquo;s designs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has learnt the cobbling trade:</p>
<p class="poetry">Or else some spy to Cavaliers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And art by them sent out<br />
To carry false intelligence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scatter lies about.</p>
<p class="poetry">But whilst the vicar full of ire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was railing at this rate,<br />
His worship, good Sir Samuel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erlighted at the gate.</p>
<p class="poetry">And asking of the landlady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; occasion of the stir;<br />
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Quoth
she, If you will give me leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will inform you, Sir.</p>
<p class="poetry">This cobbler happening to o&rsquo;ertake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar in his walk,<br />
In friendly sort they forward march,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to each other talk.</p>
<p class="poetry">Until the parson first proposed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stop and take a whet;<br />
So cheek by jole they hither came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like travellers well met.</p>
<p class="poetry">A world of healths and jests went round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes a merry tale;<br />
Till they resolved to stay all night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So well they liked my ale.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus all things lovingly went on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who so great as they;<br />
Before an ugly accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began this mortal fray.</p>
<p class="poetry">The case I take it to be this,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar being fixt,<br />
The cobbler chanced to cry his trade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his cry he mixt</p>
<p class="poetry">Some harmless words, which I suppose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar falsely thought<br />
Might be design&rsquo;d to banter him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scandalize his coat.</p>
<p class="poetry">If that be all, quoth he, go out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bid them both come in;<br />
A dozen of your nappy ale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will set &rsquo;em right again.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>And if the ale should chance to fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For so perhaps it may,<br />
I have it in my powers to try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A more effectual way.</p>
<p class="poetry">These vicars are a wilful tribe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A restless, stubborn crew;<br />
And if they are not humbled quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The State they will undo.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler is a cunning knave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That goes about by stealth,<br />
And would, instead of mending shoes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repair the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="poetry">However, bid &rsquo;em both come in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This fray must have an end;<br />
Such little feuds as these do oft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To greater mischiefs tend.</p>
<p class="poetry">Without more bidding out she goes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And told them, by her troth,<br />
There was a magistrate within<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That needs must see &rsquo;em both.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, gentlemen, pray distance keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t too testy be;<br />
Ill words good manners still corrupt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spoil good company.</p>
<p class="poetry">To this the vicar first replies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear no magistrate;<br />
For let &rsquo;em make what laws they will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll still obey the State.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whatever I can say or do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure not much avails;<br />
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>I stall
still be Vicar of Bray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whichever side prevails.</p>
<p class="poetry">My conscience, thanks to Heaven, is come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To such a happy pass,<br />
That I can take the Covenant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never hang an ass.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve took so many oaths before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That now without remorse<br />
I take all oaths the State can make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As meerly things of course.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go therefore, dame, the justice tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His summons I&rsquo;ll obey;<br />
And further you may let him know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I Vicar am of Bray.</p>
<p class="poetry">I find indeed, the cobbler said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not much mistaken;<br />
This vicar knows the ready way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To save his reverend bacon. <a
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a></p>
<p class="poetry">This is a hopeful priest indeed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well deserves a rope;<br />
Rather than lose his vicarage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d swear to Turk or Pope.</p>
<p class="poetry">For gain he would his God deny,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His country and his King;<br />
Swear and forswear, recant and lye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do any wicked thing.</p>
<p class="poetry">At this the vicar set his teeth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the cobbler flew;<br />
<a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>And with
his sacerdotal fist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave him a box or two.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler soon return&rsquo;d the blows,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with both head and heel<br />
So manfully behaved himself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the vicar reel.</p>
<p class="poetry">Great was the outcry that was made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the woman ran<br />
To tell his worship that the fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Betwixt them was began.</p>
<p class="poetry">And is it so indeed? quoth he;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make the slaves repent:<br />
Then up he took his basket hilt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And out enraged he went.</p>
<p class="poetry">The country folk no sooner saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The knight with naked blade,<br />
But for his worship instantly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An open lane was made;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who with a stern and angry look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry&rsquo;d out, What knaves are these<br />
That in the face of justice dare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disturb the public peace?</p>
<p class="poetry">Vile rascals!&nbsp; I will make you know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a magistrate,<br />
And that as such I bear about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vengeance of the State.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go, seize them, Ralph, and bring them in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may know the cause,<br />
That first induced them to this rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus to break the laws.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Ralph, who was both his squire and clerk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And constable withal,<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; name o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Commonwealth aloud<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did for assistance bawl.</p>
<p class="poetry">The words had hardly pass&rsquo;d his mouth<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they secure them both;<br />
And Ralph, to show his furious zeal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hatred to the cloth,</p>
<p class="poetry">Runs to the vicar through the crowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And takes him by the throat:<br />
How ill, says he, doth this become<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your character and coat!</p>
<p class="poetry">Was it for this not long ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You took the Covenant,<br />
And in most solemn manner swore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you&rsquo;d become a saint?</p>
<p class="poetry">And here he gave him such a pinch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made the vicar shout,&mdash;<br />
Good people, I shall murder&rsquo;d be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By this ungodly lout.</p>
<p class="poetry">He gripes my throat to that degree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t his talons bear;<br />
And if you do not hold his hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll throttle me, I fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">At this a butcher of the town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steps up to Ralph in ire,&mdash;<br />
What, will you squeeze his gullet through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You son of blood and fire?</p>
<p class="poetry">You are the Devil&rsquo;s instrument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To execute the laws;<br />
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>What,
will you murther the poor man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With your phanatick claws?</p>
<p class="poetry">At which the squire quits his hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lugging out his blade,<br />
Full at the sturdy butcher&rsquo;s pate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A furious stroke he made.</p>
<p class="poetry">A dismal outcry then began<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the country folk;<br />
Who all conclude the butcher slain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By such a mortal stroke.</p>
<p class="poetry">But here good fortune, that has still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A friendship for the brave,<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; nick misguides the fatal blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And does the butcher save.</p>
<p class="poetry">The knight, who heard the noise within,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Runs out with might and main,<br />
And seeing Ralph amidst the crowd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In danger to be slain,</p>
<p class="poetry">Without regard to age or sex<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old basket-hilt so ply&rsquo;d,<br />
That in an instant three or four<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay bleeding at his side.</p>
<p class="poetry">And greater mischiefs in his rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This furious knight had done,<br />
If he had not prevented been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Dick, the blacksmith&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p class="poetry">Who catch&rsquo;d his worship on the hip,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him such a squelch,<br />
That he some moments breathless lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere he was heard to belch.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>Nor was the squire in better case,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By sturdy butcher ply&rsquo;d,<br />
Who from the shoulder to the flank<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had soundly swinged his hide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whilst things in this confusion stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knight and squire disarm&rsquo;d,<br />
Up comes a neighbouring gentleman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcry had alarm&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who riding up among the crowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vicar first he spy&rsquo;d,<br />
With sleeveless gown and bloody band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hands behind him ty&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bless me, says he, what means all this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turning round his eyes,<br />
In the same plight, or in a worse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cobbler bleeding spies.</p>
<p class="poetry">And looking further round he saw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one in doleful dump,<br />
The knight, amidst a gaping mob,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit pensive on his rump.</p>
<p class="poetry">And by his side lay Ralph his squire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom butcher fell had maul&rsquo;d;<br />
Who bitterly bemoan&rsquo;d his fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for a surgeon call&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">Surprised at first he paused awhile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then accosts the knight,&mdash;<br />
What makes you here, Sir Samuel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this unhappy plight?</p>
<p class="poetry">At this the knight gave&rsquo;s breast a
thump,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretching out his hand,&mdash;<br />
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>If you
will pull me up, he cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try if I can stand.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then I&rsquo;ll let you know the cause;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; But first take care of Ralph,<br />
Who in my good or ill success<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth always stand my half.</p>
<p class="poetry">In short, he got his worship up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And led him in the door;<br />
Where he at length relates the tale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have told before.</p>
<p class="poetry">When he had heard the story out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gentleman replies,&mdash;<br />
It is not in my province, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your worship to advise.</p>
<p class="poetry">But were I in your worship&rsquo;s place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I&rsquo;d do,<br />
Was first to reprimand the fools,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then to let them go.</p>
<p class="poetry">I think it first advisable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take them from the rabble,<br />
And let them come and both set forth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The occasion of the squabble.</p>
<p class="poetry">This is the Vicar, Sir, of Bray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A man of no repute,<br />
The scorn and scandal of his tribe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A loose, ill-manner&rsquo;d brute.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cobbler&rsquo;s a poor strolling wretch<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; That mends my servants&rsquo; shoes;<br />
And often calls as he goes by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring me country news.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>At this his worship grip&rsquo;d his beard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in an angry mood,<br />
Swore by the laws of chivalry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That blood required blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">Besides, I&rsquo;m by the Commonwealth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrusted to chastise<br />
All knaves that straggle up and down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To raise such mutinies.</p>
<p class="poetry">However, since &rsquo;tis your request,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall be call&rsquo;d and heard;<br />
But neither Ralph nor I can grant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such rascals should be clear&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">And so, to wind the tale up short,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were call&rsquo;d in together;<br />
And by the gentlemen were ask&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What wind &rsquo;twas blew them thither.</p>
<p class="poetry">Good ale and handsome landladies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You might have nearer home;<br />
And therefore &rsquo;tis for something more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you so far are come.</p>
<p class="poetry">To which the vicar answer&rsquo;d
first,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My living is so small,<br />
That I am forced to stroll about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To try and get a call.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, quoth the cobbler, I am forced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To leave my wife and dwelling,<br />
T&rsquo; escape the danger of being press&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To go a colonelling.</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s many an honest jovial lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unwarily drawn in,<br />
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>That I
have reason to suspect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will scarce get out again.</p>
<p class="poetry">The proverb says, <i>Harm watch harm
catch</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll out of danger keep,<br />
For he that sleeps in a whole skin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth most securely sleep.</p>
<p class="poetry">My business is to mend bad soals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stitch up broken quarters:<br />
A cobbler&rsquo;s name would look but odd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among a list of martyrs.</p>
<p class="poetry">Faith, cobbler, quoth the gentleman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that shall be my case;<br />
I will neither party join,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let what will come to pass.</p>
<p class="poetry">No importunities or threats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fixt resolves shall rest;<br />
Come here, Sir Samuel, where&rsquo;s his health<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That loves old England best.</p>
<p class="poetry">I pity those unhappy fools<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, ere they were aware,<br />
Designing and ambitious men<br />

<p class="poetry">But, vicar, to come to the case,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst a senseless crowd,<br />
What urged you to such violence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made you talk so loud?</p>
<p class="poetry">Passion I&rsquo;m sure does ill become<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your character and cloath,<br />
And, tho&rsquo; the cause be ne&rsquo;er so just,<br />

183</span>Vicar, I speak it with regret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An inadvertent priest<br />
Renders himself ridiculous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every body&rsquo;s jest.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vicar to be thus rebuked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little time stood mute;<br />
But having gulp&rsquo;d his passion down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Replies,&mdash;That cobbling brute</p>
<p class="poetry">Has treated me with such contempt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such vile expressions used,<br />
That I no longer could forbear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear myself abused.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rascal had the insolence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give himself the lie,<br />
And to aver h&rsquo; had done more good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And saved more soals than I.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, further, Sir, this miscreant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell me was so bold,<br />
Our trades were very near of kin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But his was the more old.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, Sir, I will to you appeal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On such a provocation,<br />
If there was not sufficient cause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To use a little passion?</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, quoth the cobbler, with your leave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll prove it to his face,<br />
All this is mere suggestion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And foreign to the case.</p>
<p class="poetry">And since he calls so many names<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And talks so very loud,<br />
<a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>I will
be bound to make it plain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas he that raised the crowd.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, further, I will make &rsquo;t appear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He and the priests have done<br />
More mischief than the cobblers far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All over Christendom.</p>
<p class="poetry">All Europe groans beneath their yoke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And poor Great Britain owes<br />
To them her present miseries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dread of future woes.</p>
<p class="poetry">The priests of all religions are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And will be still the same,<br />
And all, tho&rsquo; in a different way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are playing the same game.</p>
<p class="poetry">At this the gentleman stood up,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cobbler, you run too fast;<br />
By thus condemning all the tribe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You go beyond your last.</p>
<p class="poetry">Much mischief has by priests been done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And more is doing still;<br />
But then to censure all alike<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be exceeding ill.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too many, I must needs confess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are mightily to blame,<br />
Who by their wicked practices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disgrace the very name.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, cobbler, still the major part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The minor should conclude;<br />
To argue at another rate&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Impertinent and rude.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Were flock&rsquo;d about the door,<br />
And some were on the vicar&rsquo;s side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the cobbler&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Among the rest a grazier, who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had lately been at town<br />
To sell his oxen and his sheep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brim-full of news came down.</p>

pray&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made so damn&rsquo;d a pother,<br />
That all the people are run mad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To murther one another.</p>
<p class="poetry">By their contrivances and arts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve play&rsquo;d their game so long,<br />
That no man knows which side is right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or which is in the wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve Smithfield market
used<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than twenty year,<br />
But never did such murmurings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dreadful outcries hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some for a church, and some a tub,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some for both together;<br />
And some, perhaps the greater part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have no regard for either.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some for a king, and some for none;<br />

To mend the Commonwealth, and make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An empire of all kings.</p>

<p class="poetry">And rulers, when they lose the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like horses overweigh&rsquo;d,<br />
Must either fall and break their knees,<br />

<p class="poetry">The vicar to be twice rebuked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No longer could contain;<br />
But thus replies,&mdash;To knaves like you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All arguments are vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Church must use her arm of flesh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other will not do;<br />
The clergy waste their breath and time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On miscreants like you.</p>
<p class="poetry">You are so stubborn and so proud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dull and prepossest,<br />
That no instructions can prevail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How well soe&rsquo;er addrest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who would reform such reprobates,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must drub them soundly first;<br />
I know no other way but that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make them wise or just.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fie, vicar, fie, his patron said,<br />

You should instruct your auditors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To suffer or obey.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The learned fathers taught;<br />
And &rsquo;twas by them the Church at first<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was to perfection brought.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, vicar, lay your feuds aside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And calmly take your cup;<br />
And let us try in friendly wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the matter up.</p>
<p class="poetry">That&rsquo;s certainly the wiser course,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And better too by far;<br />
All men of prudence strive to quench<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sparks of civil war.</p>
<p class="poetry">By furious heats and ill advice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our neighbours are undone,<br />
Then let us timely caution take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From their destruction.</p>
<p class="poetry">If we would turn our heads about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And look towards forty-one,<br />
We soon should see what little jars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those cruel wars begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">A one-eyed cobbler then was one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that rebellious crew,<br />
That did in Charles the martyr&rsquo;s blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wicked hands imbrue.</p>
<p class="poetry">I mention this not to deface<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This cobbler&rsquo;s reputation,<br />
Whom I have always honest found,<br />

<p class="poetry">But this I urge to let you see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger of a fight<br />
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Between
a cobbler and a priest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he were ne&rsquo;er so right.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vicars are a numerous tribe,<br />

And if a general quarrel rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What must the country do?</p>
<p class="poetry">Our outward and our inward soals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must quickly want repair;<br />
And all the neighbourhood around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the misfortune share.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sir, quoth the grazier, I believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our outward soals indeed<br />
May quickly want the cobbler&rsquo;s help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be from leakings freed.</p>
<p class="poetry">But for our inward souls, I think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re of a worth too great<br />
To be committed to the care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of any holy cheat,</p>
<p class="poetry">Who only serves his God for gain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion is his trade;<br />
And &rsquo;tis by such as these our Church<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So scandalous is made.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why should I trust my soul with one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That preaches, swears, and prays,<br />
And the next moment contradicts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Himself in all he says?</p>
<p class="poetry">His solemn oaths he looks upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As only words of course!<br />
Which like their wives our fathers took<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For better or for worse.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Only to serve his ease;<br />
And rogues and w&mdash;s, it is well known,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May part whene&rsquo;er they please.</p>
<p class="poetry">At this the cobbler bolder grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stoutly thus reply&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br />
If you&rsquo;re so good at drubbing, Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your manhood shall be try&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">What I have said I will maintain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And further prove withal&mdash;<br />
I daily do more good than you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In my respective call.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know your character, quoth he,<br />

Who only huff and domineer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quarrel in your liquor.</p>
<p class="poetry">The honest gentleman, who saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould come again to blows,<br />
Commands the cobbler to forbear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the vicar goes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Vicar, says he, for shame give o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mitigate your rage;<br />
You scandalize your cloth too much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cobbler to engage.</p>
<p class="poetry">All people&rsquo;s eyes are on your tribe,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And every little ill<br />
They multiply and aggravate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And will because they will.</p>

Or, what is better much than both,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I am made amends.</p>

NEW GAME AT CARDS:<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
WIN AT FIRST AND LOSE AT LAST.</h3>
<p>A popular ballad, written immediately after the restoration of
Charles II.; and in which the victorious Cavaliers render honour
to General Monk, Duke of Albemarle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Tune, &ldquo;Ye gallants that
delight to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ye</span> merry hearts that
love to play<br />
At cards, see who hath won the day;<br />
You that once did sadly sing<br />
The knave of clubs hath won the king;<br />
Now more happy times we have,<br />
The king hath overcome the knave.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not long ago a game was play&rsquo;d,<br />
When three crowns at the stakes were laid;<br />
England had no cause to boast,<br />
Knaves won that which kings had lost:<br />
Coaches gave the way to carts,<br />
And clubs were better cards than hearts.</p>
<p class="poetry">Old Noll was the knave o&rsquo; clubs,<br />
And dad of such as preach in tubs;<br />
Bradshaw, Ireton, and Pride<br />
Were three other knaves beside;<br />
And they play&rsquo;d with half the pack,<br />
Throwing out all cards but black.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the just Fates threw these four out,<br />
Which made the loyal party shout;<br />
The Pope would fain have had the stock,<br />
And with these cards have whipt his dock.<br />
But soon the Devil these cards snatches<br />
To dip in brimstone, and make matches.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>But still the sport for to maintain,<br />
Bold Lambert, Haslerigg, and Vane,<br />
With one-eyed Hewson, took their places,<br />
Knaves were better cards than aces;<br />
But Fleetwood he himself did save,<br />
Because he was more fool than knave.</p>
<p class="poetry">Cromwell, though he so much had won,<br />
Yet he had an unlucky son;<br />
He sits still, and not regards,<br />
Whilst cunning gamesters set the cards;<br />
And thus, alas! poor silly Dick,<br />
He play&rsquo;d awhile, and lost his trick.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Rumpers that had won whole towns,<br />
The spoils of martyrs and of crowns,<br />
Were not contented, but grew rough,<br />
As though they had not won enough;<br />
They kept the cards still in their hands,<br />
To play for tithes and college lands.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Presbyters began to fret<br />
That they were like to lose the sett;<br />
Unto the Rump they did appeal,<br />
And said it was their turn to deal;<br />
Then dealt with Presbyterians, but<br />
The army swore that they would cut.</p>
<p class="poetry">The foreign lands began to wonder,<br />
To see what gallants we lived under,<br />
That they, which Christians did forswear,<br />
Should follow gaming all the year,&mdash;<br />
Nay more, which was the strangest thing,<br />
To play so long without a king.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>The bold phanatics present were,<br />
Like butlers with their boxes there,<br />
Not doubting but that every game<br />
Some profit would redound to them;<br />
Because they were the gamesters&rsquo; minions,<br />
And every day broach&rsquo;d new opinions.</p>
<p class="poetry">But Cheshire men (as stories say)<br />
Began to show them gamester&rsquo;s play;<br />
Brave Booth and all his army strives<br />
To save the stakes, or lose their lives;<br />
But, oh sad fate! they were undone<br />
By playing of their cards too soon.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus all the while a club was trump,<br />
There&rsquo;s none could ever beat the Rump,<br />
Until a noble general came,<br />
And gave the cheaters a clear slam;<br />
His finger did outwit their noddy,<br />
And screw&rsquo;d up poor Jack Lambert&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Haslerigg began to scowl,<br />
And said the general play&rsquo;d foul.<br />
Look to him, partners, for I tell ye,<br />
This Monk has got a king in&rsquo;s belly.<br />
Not so, quoth Monk, but I believe<br />
Sir Arthur has a knave in&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p class="poetry">When General Monk did understand<br />
The Rump were peeping into&rsquo;s hand,<br />
He wisely kept his cards from sight,<br />
Which put the Rump into a fright;<br />
He saw how many were betray&rsquo;d<br />
That show&rsquo;d their cards before they play&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>At length, quoth he, some cards we lack,<br />
I will not play with half a pack;<br />
What you cast out I will bring in,<br />
And a new game we will begin:<br />
With that the standers-by did say<br />
They never yet saw fairer play.</p>
<p class="poetry">But presently this game was past,<br />
And for a second knaves were cast;<br />
All new cards, not stain&rsquo;d with spots,<br />
As was the Rumpers and the Scots,&mdash;<br />
Here good gamesters play&rsquo;d their parts<br />
And turn&rsquo;d up the king of hearts.</p>
<p class="poetry">After this game was done, I think<br />
The standers-by had cause to drink,<br />
And all loyal subjects sing,<br />
Farewell knaves, and welcome King;<br />
For, till we saw the King return&rsquo;d,<br />
We wish&rsquo;d the cards had all been burn&rsquo;d.</p>

I went to Court in hope to find<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly knew one face.</p>

<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">marvel</span>, Dick, that

<p class="poetry">Are we to learn what is a Court?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And brazen faces, too.</p>
<p class="poetry">The King, they say, doth still professe<br />
To give his party some redresse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cherish honestie;<br />
But his good wishes prove in vain,<br />
Whose service with his servants&rsquo; gain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not alwayes doth agree.</p>
<p class="poetry">All princes (be they ne&rsquo;er so wise)<br />
Are fain to see with others&rsquo; eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But seldom hear at all;<br />
And courtiers find their interest<br />
In time to feather well their nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing for their fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Our comfort doth on time depend,<br />
Things when they are at worst will mend;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let us but reflect<br />
On our condition th&rsquo; other day,<br />
When none but tyrants bore the sway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What did we then expect?</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile a calm retreat is best,<br />
But discontent (if not supprest)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will breed disloyaltie;<br />
This is the constant note I sing,<br />
I have been faithful to the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so shall ever be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">A Ballad by Alex. Brome.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Old</span> England is now a
brave Barbary made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every one has an ambition to ride her;<br />
King Charles was a horseman that long used the trade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But he rode in a snaffle, and that could not guide
her.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the hungry Scot comes with spur and with
switch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would teach her to run a Geneva career;<br />
His grooms were all Puritan, Traytor, and Witch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But she soon threw them down with their pedlary
geer.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Long Parliament next came all to the
block,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they this untameable palfrey would ride;<br />
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>But she
would not bear all that numerous flock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At which they were fain themselves to divide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Jack Presbyter first gets the steed by the
head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the reverend Bishops had hold of the
bridle;<br />
Jack said through the nose they their flockes did not feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But sat still on the beast and grew aged and
idle.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then comes the Rout, with broom-sticks
inspired,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pull&rsquo;d down their graces, their sleeves,
and their train;<br />
And sets up Sir Jack, who the beast quickly tyr&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a journey to Scotland and thence back
again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Jack rode in a doublet, with a yoke of
prick-ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cursed splay-mouth and a Covenant spur,<br />
Rides switching and spurring with jealousies and fears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the poor famish&rsquo;d beast was not able to
stir.</p>
<p class="poetry">Next came th&rsquo; Independent&mdash;a
dev&rsquo;lish designer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And got himself call&rsquo;d by a holier
name&mdash;<br />
Makes Jack to unhorse, for he was diviner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would make her travel as far&rsquo;s
Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="poetry">But Nol, a rank-rider, gets first in the
saddle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made her show tricks, and curvate, and
rebound;<br />
<a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>She
quickly perceived that he rode widdle waddle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like his coach-horses threw his Highness to
ground.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Dick, being lame, rode holding by the
pummel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not having the wit to get hold of the rein;<br />
But the jade did so snort at the sight of a Cromwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That poor Dick and his kindred turn&rsquo;d footmen
again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Next Fleetwood and Vane with their rascally
pack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would every one put their feet in the stirrup;<br />
But they pull&rsquo;d the saddle quite off of her back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And were all got under her before they were up.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last the King mounts her, and then she stood
still;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As his Bucephalus, proud of this rider,<br />
She cheerfully yields to his power and skill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is careful to feed her, and skilful to guide
her.</p>

<p class="poetry">Wine the most powerfull&rsquo;st of all things
on earth,<br />
Which stifles cares and sorrows in their birth;<br />

Eternal joy to him that loves the King.</p>

He&rsquo;s no room for treason that&rsquo;s top-full of wine.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(July 17th, 1660.)&mdash;From the
King&rsquo;s Pamphlets, British Museum.</p>
<p>This ballad relates to the disbanding of the Parliamentary
army.&nbsp; Contrary, however, to what is pretended in it, says
Mr. Wright, in his volume printed for the Percy Society, the
writers of the time mention with admiration the good conduct of
the soldiers after they were disbanded, each betaking himself to
some honest trade or calling, with as much readiness as if he had
never been employed in any other way.&nbsp; Not many weeks before
the date of the present ballad, a prose tract had been published,
with the same title, &ldquo;The Lamentation of a Bad Market, or
Knaves and Fools foully foyled, and fallen into a Pit of their
own digging,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; March 21st, 1659&ndash;60.</p>

<p class="poetry">Jamie the Valiant, the Champion Royal,<br />

No Helicon like to the juice of good wine is,<br />
For Phoebus had never had wit that divine is,<br />
Had his face not been bow-dy&rsquo;d as thine is and mine is.</p>
<p class="poetry">This must go round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Off with your hats till the pavement be
crown&rsquo;d with your beavers;<br />
A red-coated face frights a sergeant and his mace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the constables tremble to shivers.<br />
In state march our faces like some of that quorum,<br />
While the . . . do fall down and the vulgar adore &rsquo;um,<br

And our noses like link-boys run shining before &rsquo;um.</p>

<h3>CANARY&rsquo;S CORONATION.</h3>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span>, let&rsquo;s
purge our brains<br />
From ale and grains,<br />

From whose blood may spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sparkling progeny;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose flames are bright and clear;<br />
We&rsquo;ll not bind our hands with drayman&rsquo;s bands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When as we may be freer;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; To popular ale or beer?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; For which we all are met?<br />
Claret is a prince that hath long since<br />

His face is spread with a warlike seed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so he loves to see men;<br />
When he bears the sway, his subjects they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be as good as freemen;<br />
But here&rsquo;s the plot, almost forgot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too much burnt with women.</p>

The German wine will warm the chine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And frisk in every vein;<br />
&rsquo;Twill make the bride forget to chide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And call him to&rsquo;t again:<br />
But that&rsquo;s not all, he is too small<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be our sovereign.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let us never think of a noble drink,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with notes advance on high,<br />
Let&rsquo;s proclaim good Canary&rsquo;s name,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven bless his Majesty!<br />
He is a King in everything,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose nature doth renounce all,<br />
He&rsquo;ll make us skip and nimbly trip<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From ceiling to the groundsil;<br />
Especially when poets be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the Privy Council.</p>

The bar-boys shall be pages all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tavern well-prepared,<br />
And nothing shall be spared;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In jovial sort shall be the court,<br />
Wine-porters that are soldiers tall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be yeomen of the guard.</p>
<p class="poetry">But if a cooper we with a red nose see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In any part of the town;<br />
The cooper shall, with his aids-royal,<br />

Young wits that wash away their cash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wine and recreation,<br />
Who hates ale and beer, shall be welcome here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give their approbation;<br />
So shall all you that will allow<br />

<h3>ACCESSION OF JAMES II.</h3>
<p>From &ldquo;Read&rsquo;s Weekly Journal, or British
Gazetteer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saturday, May 15th, 1731.&nbsp; This was
a Jacobite Journal, and this song was reproduced at the time,
from an earlier period.&nbsp; The allusions are evidently to the
death of Charles II. and the succession of James II.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> means, honest
shepherd, this cloud on thy brow?<br />
Say, where is thy mirth and thy melody now?<br />
Thy pipe thrown aside, and thy looks full of thought,<br />
As silent and sad as a bird newly caught.<br />
Has any misfortune befallen thy flocks,<br />
Some lamb been betray&rsquo;d by the craft of the fox;<br />
Or murrain, more fatal, just seized on thy herd;<br />
Or has thy dear Phyllis let slip a cross word?</p>
<p class="poetry">The season indeed may to musing incline,<br />
Now that grey-bearded Winter makes Autumn resign;<br />
The hills all around us their russet put on,<br />
And the skies seem in mourning for loss of the sun.<br />
<a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>The
winds make the tree, where thou sitt&rsquo;st, shake its head;<br
/>
Yet tho&rsquo; with dry leaves mother earth&rsquo;s lap is
spread,<br />
Her bosom, to cheer it, is verdant with wheat,<br />
And the woods can supply us with pastime and meat.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! no, says the shepherd, I mourn none of
these,<br />
Content with such changes as Heaven shall please;<br />
Tho&rsquo; now we have got the wrong side of the year,<br />
&rsquo;Twill turn up again, and fresh beauties appear:<br />
But the loss that I grieve for no time can restore;<br />
Our master that lov&rsquo;d us so well is no more;<br />
That oak which we hop&rsquo;d wou&rsquo;d long shelter us all,<br
/>
Is fallen; then well may we shake at its fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where find we a pastor so kind and so good,<br
/>
So careful to feed us with wholesomest food,<br />
To watch for our safety, and drive far away<br />
The sly prouling fox that would make us his prey?<br />
Oh! may his remembrance for ever remain<br />
To shame those hard shepherds who, mindful of gain,<br />
Only look at their sheep with an eye to the fleece,<br />
And watch &rsquo;em but so as the fox watch&rsquo;d the
geese.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whom now shall I choose for the theme of my
song?<br />
Or must my poor pipe on the willow be hung?<br />
No more to commend that good nature and sense,<br />
Which always cou&rsquo;d please, but ne&rsquo;er once gave
offence.<br />
What honour directed he firmly pursu&rsquo;d,<br />
Yet would not his judgment on others intrude;<br />
<a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>Still
ready to help with his service and vote,<br />
But ne&rsquo;er to thrust oar in another man&rsquo;s boat.</p>
<p class="poetry">No more, honest shepherd, these sorrows
resound,<br />
The virtues thou praisest, so hard to be found,<br />
Are yet not all fled, for the swain who succeeds<br />
To his fields and his herds is true heir to his deeds;<br />
His pattern he&rsquo;ll follow, his gentleness use,<br />
Take care of the shepherds and cherish the muse:<br />
Then cease for the dead thy impertinent care,<br />
Rejoice, he survives in his brother and heir.</p>

Lancashire enjoyed an unhappy pre-eminence in the annals of

execution of a number of persons in 1612, who were pretended to
have been associated together in the crime of witchcraft, and who
held their unearthly meetings at the Malkin Tower, in the forest
of Pendle.&nbsp; In 1613 was published an account of the trials,
in a thick pamphlet, entitled &ldquo;The Wonderful Discoverie of

Parliament was, &ldquo;That the late petition of the fanatique
people presented by Barebone, for the imposing of an oath upon
all sorts of people, was received by the House with
thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The citizens did not omit to show their
hostility against the presenter of the petition.&nbsp; On the

the Parliamentary array.&nbsp; On the 17th January, 1660, he
incurred the displeasure of the House, and was sequestered from
his seat and sent to the Tower.&nbsp; He is described as &ldquo;a
smart, prating apprentice, newly set for himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
appears to have been originally a grocer and tobacconist; a
ballad of the time speaks of him as,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Salloway with tobacco<br />
Inspired, turned State quack-o;<br />
And got more by his feigned zeal<br />
Then by his, <i>What d&rsquo;ye lack-o</i>?&rdquo;</p>

pounds a year.&nbsp; A ballad written towards the end of 1659
says of him,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Baron Hill was but a

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
